## BMAD-METHOD Integration

Use `/bmalph` to navigate phases. Use `/bmad-help` to discover all commands. Use `/bmalph-status` for a quick overview. See `_bmad/COMMANDS.md` for a full command reference.

### Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Commands |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Analysis | Understand the problem | `/create-brief`, `/brainstorm-project`, `/market-research` |
| 2. Planning | Define the solution | `/create-prd`, `/create-ux` |
| 3. Solutioning | Design the architecture | `/create-architecture`, `/create-epics-stories`, `/implementation-readiness` |
| 4. Implementation | Build it | `/sprint-planning`, `/create-story`, then `/bmalph-implement` for Ralph |

### Workflow

1. Work through Phases 1-3 using BMAD agents and workflows (interactive, command-driven)
2. Run `/bmalph-implement` to transition planning artifacts into Ralph format, then start Ralph

### Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/bmalph-status` | Show current phase, Ralph progress, version info |
| `/bmalph-implement` | Transition planning artifacts → prepare Ralph loop |
| `/bmalph-upgrade` | Update bundled assets to match current bmalph version |
| `/bmalph-doctor` | Check project health and report issues |
